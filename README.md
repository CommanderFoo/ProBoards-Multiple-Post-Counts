Multiple Post Counts 1.0.0
==========================

Requires Yootil: https://proboards.com/library/plugins/item/38

Request: http://support.proboards.com/thread/656119/

If you have a custom profile, then you can add an element with the class `multiple-post-counts` and the plugin will look for that to populate the list of post counts.
